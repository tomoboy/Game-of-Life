This project is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using React with Material-UI.
I made this just for fun during the xmas holiday to get some practice with React.
I'm using the naive algorithm for calculating cell state, on my computer that is fine for board up to at least 250*250 cells.
I've used canvas to draw the board as I found this simple to use and efficient enough.

I will probably keep adding some more shapes.
